Air pollution kills around 3 million people globally every year, making it essential to understand and mitigate poor air quality. The invisible nature of air pollutants makes them difficult to study, but their impacts on human health and activities are alarmingly tangible. In the Tessum group, we focus on atmospheric modeling, emission assessment, and machine learning to revolutionize air quality analysis. Our goal is to create interventions that could save millions of lives.

My work began with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This model simulates the behavior of airborne particles and gases, but it's complex and computationally demandingâ€”initially requiring 30GB of data and being written in Fortran. To make it more efficient and compatible with machine learning, I optimized it through a Julia script. I validated this model using a 24-hour data snapshot, later compressing it to a one-hour slice for computing capabilities.

The next phase involved creating an emission model by integrating heat equations and advection principles. These equations describe heat distribution over time and the transport of substances by the bulk motion of a fluid, respectively. The real-world application came when I used actual data to describe the motion of SO2 pollutants, incorporating wind vector information. I applied the effects of wind as a constant multiplier in my equations to generate an emission model specific to conditions in the southern U.S. This laid the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting air quality under various conditions.

Lastly, I tackled the issue of making the CMAQ model more accessible for collaborative work. Installing and running the CMAQ software on individual devices proved to be a bottleneck, especially given its complexity and computational requirements. To circumvent this, I successfully demonstrated that the entire CMAQ model could be hosted on an AWS virtual directory. This approach allows collaborators to easily download the model and engage in joint research efforts, further democratizing the tools necessary for vital air quality research.
